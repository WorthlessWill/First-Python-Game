# My Python games
This repository has 2 games. The first game is Pong, which I made for the uOttawa EMCP course. The next one is one I made myself called "Samurai Defense".
There are descriptions for both games, controls and instructions for how to install them.


# Pong
In this game, you and another player control paddles to deflect a moving ball. If you get the ball past the other player's side, you earn a point. 
You need Python installed to play.

Controls: 

W: Player 1 Up

S: Player 1 Down

Up: Player 2 Up

Down: Player 2 Down

# Samurai Defense

Installation process:
Install Python and the pygame module using "pip install pygame" in the Windows Command Prompt. Make sure that the "sassets" folder is in the same location as "samurai.py".

Description:
In this game, you are a samurai defending your castle against invading soldiers. Enemies spawn at the top of the screen and if they get to the bottom, your castle takes damage. To stop the enemies, shoot them with your bow and arrow. Enemies will also shoot back at you!
